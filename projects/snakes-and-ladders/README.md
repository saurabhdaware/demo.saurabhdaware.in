# Snakes and Ladders Demo 

This is a snakes and ladders demo built in vanilla JavaScript. 

To run this, you can download `index.html` and `game.js` and open `index.html` in your browser.

*Note: This game is intended to teach JavaScript and thus not cover most of the edge cases. Also, it is single player for now.*
